## Case Study: XYZ Financial Services
### Company Background
XYZ Financial Services specializes in offering tailored financial products. The sales team makes outbound calls to customers, introducing them to new financial products and services.

### Insights for Stakeholders
1. Agent Insights:
- Top-performing agents (e.g., agents with the highest total sales and conversion rates).
- Agents with low performance requiring training.

2. Customer Insights:
- High-value customers (customers purchasing the most products).
- Average pickup rates to assess customer engagement.

3. Call Insights:
- Calls with the highest success rates.
- Optimal call durations for sales conversions.

### Actionable Recommendations
- Promote or reward agents with consistently high performance.
- Provide additional training to agents with low conversion rates.
- Optimize call durations to improve efficiency and conversion rates.


## 4. Decision-Making for Promotions or Salary Increases
1. Use the Agent Performance Chart to rank agents by:
- Total products sold.
- Conversion rate.
- Average call duration.

2. Reward top-performing agents with promotions or salary increases.
Example criteria:
- Agents with sales in the top 10% and conversion rates above the median.
- Recognize agents reducing call durations without impacting sales.


By following this process, I was able to derive actionable insights that helped XYZ Financial Services make data-driven decisions regarding agent performance, customer behavior, and call strategy.
