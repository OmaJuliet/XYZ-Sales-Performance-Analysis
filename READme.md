4. Overall Business Metrics:
- Total products sold.
- Total calls made.
- Correlation between call duration and sales.

5. Decision-Making Insights:
- Identify top-performing agents for promotion or salary increase.
- Determine areas for training (e.g., agents with low conversion rates).


## 2. Perform DataÂ Analysis
### Step 1: Data Cleaning UsingÂ Python
- Import lbraries
- Load the dataset
- Check for missing values
